question 1:
int i=10;
while(i){
    cout<<i<<endl;
    i--;
}
output: 
10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1

question 2.:
int i=1;
while(i) {
    cout<<i<<endl;
    i++;
}
output: firstly it will print upto a maximum positive range the after that it will start from -1 uto its maximum

question 3:
int i=1;
while(i<=10) {
    cout<<i<<endl;
    i++;
}
output: 1to 10 will be printed

question 4:
int main()
{
    int i = 1;
    while (i++ <= 10) firstly, condition is checked then the increment is done  

    {
        cout << i << endl;
        i++;
    }
}
output: 
2
4
6
8
10

question 5:
while(5){
    cout<<"hello"<<endl;--5;
}
this will show the error, increment and decrement operators are not used with numbers, only with constants

question 6:
int i=1
for(){
    cout<<i<<endl;
    i++;
}
output:this is an infinite loop as the increment of i has nothing to do with for loop,no condition is given in for loop

question 7:
for(int i=1;i<=10;i++) {
    if(i==5); continue;
    cout<<i<<"hello world"<<endl;
}
output: 
1hello world
2hello world
3hello world
4hello world
6hello world
7hello world
8hello world
9hello world
10hello world
